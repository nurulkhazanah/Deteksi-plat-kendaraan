# üöò Vehicle License Plate Detection

A web-based vehicle license plate detection and recognition application using Faster R-CNN and EasyOCR, deployed with Gradio. Users can upload vehicle images and receive predictions for license plate location and extracted text, along with identification of the region of origin based on the plate prefix. The application also provides an interactive interface for easy demonstration.

## üß† Model Architecture
Faster R-CNN: This is the deep learning model specifically employed for vehicle license plate detection in images. The frcnn.pth file represents this trained Faster R-CNN model.
EasyOCR: This is a Python library that comes equipped with its own pre-trained models for optical character recognition (OCR). Its role is to extract text from the license plates that Faster R-CNN has detected.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

Python (Core programming language)
Faster R-CNN (For object detection, specifically license plates)
EasyOCR (For Optical Character Recognition)
Gradio (For building the interactive web interface)
PyTorch (Underlying framework for Faster R-CNN, as frcnn.pth indicates a PyTorch model)
OpenCV (Likely used for image processing)
NumPy (For numerical operations)
Pillow (For image handling)
Hugging Face Spaces (For application deployment)

## üìä Dataset

This project utilizes a custom-collected dataset sourced from Roboflow, under the project name "vehicle-and-license-plate".

Dataset Details:

Total Images: The dataset comprises 2,167 images.
Object Classes: The images are annotated with bounding boxes covering five object classes: bus, cars, license_plate, motorcycle, and truck. While the dataset contains these various vehicle types, the primary focus of this project is specifically on the license_plate object for further processing (OCR and region identification).
Annotations: Each image is meticulously annotated with bounding boxes around the vehicle license plate areas.
Image Conditions: The dataset was collected under diverse conditions and from various viewpoints, featuring varying resolutions. This diversity supports the model's generalization capabilities.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Model Training Process

The Faster R-CNN model was trained for 20 epochs using SGD optimizer (with 0.9 momentum, 0.0005 weight decay, 0.01 initial learning rate) on Google Colaboratory's GPU. Performance was monitored using validation data, with mAP, Precision, and Recall as key metrics.
